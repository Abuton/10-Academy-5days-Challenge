    "In this challenge, you will consider the state of North Carolina data set containing information on births recorded in this state. This data set is useful to researchers studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. \n",

    "**The following is the variable descriptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "| variable         | description |\n",
    "| ---------------- | ------------|\n",
    "| `fage`           | father's age in years. |\n",
    "| `mage`           | mother's age in years. |\n",
    "| `mature`         | maturity status of mother. |\n",
    "| `weeks`          | length of pregnancy in weeks. |\n",
    "| `premie`         | whether the birth was classified as premature (premie) or full-term. |\n",
    "| `visits`         | number of hospital visits during pregnancy. |\n",
    "| `marital`        | whether mother is `married` or `not married` at birth. |\n",
    "| `gained`         | weight gained by mother during pregnancy in pounds. |\n",
    "| `weight`         | weight of the baby at birth in pounds. |\n",
    "| `lowbirthweight` | whether baby was classified as low birthweight (`low`) or not (`not low`). |\n",
    "| `gender`         | gender of the baby, `female` or `male`. |\n",
    "| `habit`          | status of the mother as a `nonsmoker` or a `smoker`. |\n",

    "\n",
    "**Based on this data, perform the following tasks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make a side-by-side boxplot of habit and weight. What does the plot highlight about the relationship between these two variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write the hypotheses for testing if the average weights of babies born to smoking and non-smoking mothers are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conduct a hypothesis test evaluating whether the average weight gained by younger mothers is different than the average weight gained by mature mothers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct a confidence interval for the difference between the weights of babies born to smoking and non-smoking mothers."
